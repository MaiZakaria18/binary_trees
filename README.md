## Tasks

1. **New Node**: Write a function that creates a binary tree node.
2. **Insert Left**: Write a function that inserts a node as the left-child of another node.
3. **Insert Right**: Write a function that inserts a node as the right-child of another node.
4. **Delete**: Write a function that deletes an entire binary tree.
5. **Is Leaf**: Write a function that checks if a node is a leaf.
6. **Is Root**: Write a function that checks if a given node is a root.
7. **Pre-order Traversal**: Write a function that goes through a binary tree using pre-order traversal.
8. **In-order Traversal**: Write a function that goes through a binary tree using in-order traversal.
9. **Post-order Traversal**: Write a function that goes through a binary tree using post-order traversal.
10. **Height**: Write a function that measures the height of a binary tree.
11. **Depth**: Write a function that measures the depth of a node in a binary tree.
12. **Size**: Write a function that measures the size of a binary tree.
13. **Leaves**: Write a function that counts the leaves in a binary tree.
14. **Nodes**: Write a function that counts the nodes with at least 1 child in a binary tree.
15. **Balance Factor**: Write a function that measures the balance factor of a binary tree.
16. **Is Full**: Write a function that checks if a binary tree is full.
17. **Is Perfect**: Write a function that checks if a binary tree is perfect.
18. **Sibling**: Write a function that finds the sibling of a node.
19. **Uncle**: Write a function that finds the uncle of a node.
